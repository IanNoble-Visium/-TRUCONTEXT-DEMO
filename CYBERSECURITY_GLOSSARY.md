### **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**
**Definition**: A sophisticated, long-term cyberattack where attackers gain unauthorized access to a network and remain undetected for extended periods (months or years).  
**Business Impact**: APTs can result in massive data breaches, intellectual property theft, and significant financial losses. They're often state-sponsored or conducted by highly skilled criminal organizations.  
**TruContext Context**: Our threat path analysis helps identify potential APT attack routes before they're exploited, showing exactly how an attacker could move through your network undetected.

### **Attack Path Analysis (APA)**
**Definition**: The process of identifying and analyzing all possible routes an attacker could take to reach critical assets within an organization's network.  
**Business Impact**: Understanding attack paths helps prioritize security investments and defensive measures where they'll be most effective.  
**TruContext Context**: This is TruContext's core capability - we automatically generate realistic attack scenarios showing exactly how threats could progress through your infrastructure.

### **Attack Surface**
**Definition**: The total number of entry points (applications, services, devices) that an attacker could potentially exploit to gain unauthorized access to your systems.  
**Business Impact**: A larger attack surface means more opportunities for cybercriminals to find vulnerabilities. Reducing attack surface is a key security strategy.  
**TruContext Context**: Our visualization helps you see your entire attack surface at once, making it easier to identify and secure potential entry points.
